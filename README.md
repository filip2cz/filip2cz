# About me
- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Filip KomÃ¡rek
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux and operating systems at all
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Shell, Powershell scripts and C#

# Operating systems I can handle
- Linux: I use it on my notebook and on servers
- Windows: I have it on my desktop :( bcs. videogames
- FreeBSD: basic knowledge and operability

I don't really like dualboot, because rebooting the OS is annoying and multitasking is a problem


# My setup
- Desktop: Windows 10 (and I don't like it)
- Notebook: openSUSE Leap 15.4
- Servers: openSUSE Leap 15.4 / Ubuntu 22.04
- Orange Pi: Armbian
