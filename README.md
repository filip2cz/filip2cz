# About me
- I’m Filip Komárek
- I’m interested in Linux and operating systems at all
- I’m currently learning C#

# Operating systems I can handle
- Linux: I use it on my notebook and on servers
- Windows: I have it on my desktop :( bcs. videogames
- FreeBSD: basic knowledge and operability

I don't really like dualboot, because rebooting the OS is annoying and problematic multitasking, so I am stuck on Windows on some devices for this reason.

# My setup
- Desktop: Windows 10 (and I don't like it, but videogames)
  - more info: http://fkomarek.eu/pc.php
- Notebook - personal: Windows 10 (bcs. NVidia can't create working drivers for linux)
- Notebook - work: Windows 10 (bcs. I have to)
- Servers: openSUSE / Ubuntu / Alpine
- Orange Pi: Armbian, Debian
