# About me
- 👋 I’m Filip Komárek
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux and operating systems at all
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Shell

# Operating systems I can handle
- Linux: I use it on my laptop and on servers
- Windows: I have it on my desktop :( bcs. videogames
- FreeBSD: basic knowledge and operability

I don't really like dualboot, because rebooting the OS is annoying and multitasking is a problem

# My setup
- Desktop: Windows 10
- Notebook: GeckoLinux Rolling (based on openSUSE Tumbleweed)
- Server: Ubuntu 20.04
- Orange Pi: Armbian
